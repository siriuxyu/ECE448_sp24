'''
This is the module you'll submit to the autograder.

There are several function definitions, here, that raise RuntimeErrors.  You should replace
each "raise RuntimeError" line with a line that performs the function specified in the
function's docstring.

import numpy as np

epsilon = 1e-3

def compute_transition(model):
    '''
    Parameters:
    model - the MDP model returned by load_MDP()

    Output:
    P - An M x N x 4 x M x N numpy array. P[r, c, a, r', c'] is the probability that the agent will move from cell (r, c) to (r', c') if it takes action a, where a is 0 (left), 1 (up), 2 (right), or 3 (down).

    raise RuntimeError("You need to write this part!")

def compute_utility(model, U_current, P):
    '''
    Parameters:
    model - The MDP model returned by load_MDP()
    U_current - The current utility function, which is an M x N array
    P - The precomputed transition matrix returned by compute_transition()

    Output:
    U_next - The updated utility function, which is an M x N array
    '''
    raise RuntimeError("You need to write this part!")

def value_iterate(model):
    '''
    Parameters:
    model - The MDP model returned by load_MDP()

    Output:
    U - The utility function, which is an M x N array
    '''
    raise RuntimeError("You need to write this part!")

def policy_evaluation(model):
    '''
    Parameters:
    model - The MDP model returned by load_MDP();
    
    Output:
    U - The converged utility function, which is an M x N array
