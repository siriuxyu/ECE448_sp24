'''
This is the module you'll submit to the autograder.

There are several function definitions, here, that raise RuntimeErrors.  You should replace
each "raise RuntimeError" line with a line that performs the function specified in the
function's docstring.

For implementation of this MP, You may use numpy (though it's not needed). You may not 
use other non-standard modules (including nltk). Some modules that might be helpful are 
already imported for you.

def baseline(test, train):
    '''
    Implementation for the baseline tagger.
    input:  test data (list of sentences, no tags on the words, use utils.strip_tags to remove tags from data)
            training data (list of sentences, with tags on the words)
    output: list of sentences, each sentence is a list of (word,tag) pairs.
            E.g., [[(word1, tag1), (word2, tag2)], [(word3, tag3), (word4, tag4)]]

    raise NotImplementedError("You need to write this part!")


def viterbi(test, train):
    '''
    Implementation for the viterbi tagger.
    input:  test data (list of sentences, no tags on the words)
            training data (list of sentences, with tags on the words)
    output: list of sentences with tags on the words
            E.g., [[(word1, tag1), (word2, tag2)], [(word3, tag3), (word4, tag4)]]
    '''

def viterbi_ec(test, train):
    '''
    Implementation for the improved viterbi tagger.
    input:  test data (list of sentences, no tags on the words). E.g.,  [[word1, word2], [word3, word4]]
            training data (list of sentences, with tags on the words). E.g.,  [[(word1, tag1), (word2, tag2)], [(word3, tag3), (word4, tag4)]]
    output: list of sentences, each sentence is a list of (word,tag) pairs.
